<h1>
<strong> TACOS ARE LIFEEEE
</h1>
<p> I'm Mexican, Mexicans basiclly invnted tacos. There's a big variety of tacos because of us. My favorite is Taco de Bistec (steak). I love meats ;), whenever I visit the zoo and see a cow I automatically get hungry and like ooooooooooh thats some nice cow and begin my journey to find the nearest Mcdonalds.</p>

<title> My vegan friend </title>
<p> Her name is Stephanie, when I first met her i was like oooh tacos tacos yassssss tacos tacos becasue we're both mexican. So imagine the shock on my face when I found out she was a vegan. I was like hollla hollaaa  hollla hollla holla hollla, a vegan that's mexican , that's basically saying like you're white and won't shoot down a school,TF. I respect her dicision on not going for meat even though they're great and big and thick and very juicy that all make my night ;). And would leave it at that but she's always like ewwwww how can you eat that tf you wild ho, and I would respond with  "hooooooooo you need to chillllllll ok I hope natural selection comes for you and laeter say that I'm honestly trying to have a nice lunch while having a nice conversation and I'm honestly feeling so attacked right now" she just laughs the embarrassment away and shuts up. I just don't understand why some vegans like bragging that they're vegans and then shame us whenever we eat meat, like bitch I hope natural selection comes for your annoying ass. We respect your decision on backing away from the meat now respect our decision on not following what you believe in.</p>
